### About Me 💡
I’m a Computer Science student who enjoys understanding how systems work behind the scenes — from networks and operating systems to how security tools detect and respond to threats.

My interest in cybersecurity grew from curiosity rather than career planning. I like digging into *why* things work, how data moves across networks, and how security teams protect real-world systems. That curiosity has pushed me to learn both through coursework and hands-on labs outside of class.
